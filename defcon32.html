<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Welcome to the 2024 H@ck3r Runway landing page.</strong></span></h2>
<p>We returned to Defcon 32 for the 6th time and it was a amazing. There a few returning contestats and lots of new contestants to grace the runway. Hack3r Runw@y continued to bring out all the chic geeks out there. It encouraged rethinking fashion in the eyes of hackers/pentesters. There were smartwear, LED additions, obfuscation, cosplay or just everyday wear using fabrics and textures that are familiar to the community. There were a surprising amount of on-the-spot entries that left with prizes following a LED sewing workshop held at the Defcon Makerspace. Contestants entered clothing, shoes, jewelry, hats or accessories. If it was wearable, it was perfect for the runway. For convenience, contestants entered the contest with designs made ahead of the conference, however it needed to be made by them and not just store bought. Defcon 32 had a few more winners than in the past. The People's choice winner was  Divintrio's Constellation  Suit. There were so many great entries for the people's choice and the audience vote was so close that we had to pick 2 other winners: Gabi's Party Jacket was 2nd and Jess's Arc Reactor was 3rd. Jess entered after attending her first LED sewing class. </p>
